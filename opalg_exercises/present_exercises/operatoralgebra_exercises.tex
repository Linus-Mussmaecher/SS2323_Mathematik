\section{Exercise sheet 1}

\begin{exercise}
	(1)
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Case 1}: If $b_1, b_2 \in A$, then $b_i = \alpha_i a$ for certain $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{C}$. Thus, $b_1 \cdot b_2 = \alpha_1 \alpha_2 a^2 = 0$. Thus, the multiplication is trivial. From this, it immediately follows that $\phi: \algebra{A} \to \algebra{M}, \lambda a \mapsto \qmatrix{0 & \lambda \\ 0 & 0}$ is an isomorphism.

	\textbf{Case 2}: $\lambda \neq 0$, and $a^2 = \lambda a$. Let $b = \frac{1}{\lambda} a$, then $b \cdot a = a = a \cdot b$. But then, for any $c = \mu a \in \algebra{A}$, we have $b c = \mu b a = \mu a = c = c b$, so the algebra is unital and isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$.

\begin{exercise}[2]
	We consider pathological examples for $C_0(X)$.

	Let $X = \closure{\{x_0\}}$, e.g. $x_0 \in X$ with $\topology{O}(X) = \{\{x_0\} \cup Y \mid Y \subset X\} \cup \{\emptyset\}$. $X$ is highly non-Hausdorff unless we already have $X = \{x_0\}$.	In this space, the constant sequence $(x_0)$ converges to any $x \in X$.

	For a continuous function $f: X \to \mathds{C}$, this implies $f(x_0) \to f(x)$ for all $x \in X$, so every continuous function must already be constant. It follows that $C(X) \simeq \mathds{C}$.

	We now look at $C_0(X) = \{f \in C(X) \mid \forall_{\epsilon > 0} \{x \in X \mid  |f(x)| \geq \epsilon \} \text{ is compact.}\}$. But since all functions are constant, we can use $f(x_0)$ instead of $X$ and $\{x \in X \mid  |f(x)| \geq \epsilon \}$ is either empty or the whole space. $X$ is compact if and only if $X$ is finite. From here on, assume $X$ to be infinite. Then, only the finite subsets are compact. Thus, if we now have $f \not \equiv 0$, there exists an $|f(x_0)| > \epsilon > 0$ and thus $\{x \in X \mid  |f(x)| \geq \epsilon \} = X$ is not compact. This implies $C_0(X) = \{0\}$.

	To find a non-compact topological space that has non-zero unital $C_0(X)$, consider $X = X_0 \sqcup X_1$ with $X_0$ as before and $X_1$ compact.
\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $\phi: \algebra{A} \to \algebra{B}$ be a $^*$-homomorphism between $C^*$-algebras. Then we already have $\|\phi(a)\| \leq \|a\|$ for all $a \in \algebra{A}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}[4 - Products]
	Let $(A_i)_{i \in I}$ be a family of $C^*$-algebras and define
	\begin{equation*}
		\prod_{i \in I} A_i = \{a = (a_i)_{i \in I} \mid a_i \in A_i \forall_{i \in I} \text{ and } \|a\| := \sup_{i \in I} \|a_i\| < \infty \}\text{.}
	\end{equation*}
	Addition, multiplication and involution are defined coordinate-wise. We can prove that adding, multiplying and involving any bounded sequence yields another bounded sequence, so these are well-defined. We can also prove the $C^*$-axiom.
\end{exercise}

\begin{remark}[Differences between product and direct sum]~\\
	In addition to the product space, we define
	\begin{equation*}
		\bigoplus_{i \in I} A_i = \left\{(a_i) \in \prod_{i \in I} A_i \mid \forall_{\epsilon > 0} \exists_{\text{finite }F \subseteq I} \forall_{i \notin F} \|a_i\| < \epsilon\right\}\text{.}
	\end{equation*}
	This is a closed subspace of $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ as the closure of $\bigoplus_{i \in I}^{alg} A_i$, where
	\begin{equation*}
		\bigoplus_{i \in I}^{alg} A_i = \left\{(a_i) \in \prod_{i \in I} A_i \mid \exists_{\text{finite }F \subseteq I} \forall_{i \notin F} \|a_i\| = 0\right\}\text{.}
	\end{equation*}
	For finite $I$, these are all equal. We see that any element in the direct sum can be approximated by a sequence of elements in the algebraic sum. This direct sum is a closed two-sided ideal in the product.

	The product has the following universal property:
	We have (surjective) $^*$-homomorphisms $\pi_j:  \prod_{i \in I} A_i \to A_j$ for all $j \in I$.
	If $B$ is any $C^*$-algebra with $^*$-homomorphisms $\phi_j \to A_j$ for every $j \in I$, there is a unique $^*$-homomorphism $\phi: B \to \prod_{i \in I} A_i$ such that  $\pi_j \circ \phi = \phi_j$.
	This is equivalent to the commutativity of the following diagram:
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			B \arrow{r}{\phi_j} \arrow{d}{\phi} & A_j\\
			A  \arrow[swap]{ur}{\pi_j}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}[5]
	$X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space that can be written as $X = U \cup V$ with open and disjoint $U,V$ (so $U,V$ are clopen). We want to prove $C_0(X) \simeq C_0(U) \oplus C_0(V)$. To build this map, we map $f \mapsto (f|_U, f|_V)$. We check that this is well-defined and a $^*$-isomorphism.
