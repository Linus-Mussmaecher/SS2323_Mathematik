\subsection{Quasi-nilpotent elements}

Consider the space $\ell^2$  and the operator
\begin{equation*}
    T: \ell^2 \to \ell^2, (x_0, x_1, \dots) \mapsto \left(0, \frac{x_1}{2}, \frac{x_2}{2^2}, \dots, \frac{x_k}{2^k}\right)
\end{equation*}
in the Banach algebra of (normed) operators on $\ell^2$. Then we have $\|T\| = 1/2$ and
\begin{equation*}
    T^2(x_0, x_1, \dots) = \left(0, \frac{0}{2}, \frac{x_0}{2^{1+2}}, \frac{x_1}{2^{2 + 3}, \dots}\right)
\end{equation*}
as well as
\begin{equation*}
    T^n(x_0, x_1, \dots) = \bigg(\underbrace{0, 0, \dots, 0}_{n \text{ zeroes}}, \frac{x_0}{2^{1 + 2 + \dots + n}}, \frac{x_1}{2^{2 + 3 + \dots + (n+1)}}, \dots \bigg)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Then $T^n(1, 0, \dots) = (0, \dots, 0, 1/2^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}, 0, \dots) \neq (0, 0, \dots)$ and $T$ is therefore not nilpotent.
Furthermore, we can calculate the norm of $T$:
\begin{align*}
    \|T^n(x_0, x_1, \dots)\| =\sum_{k = n}^{\infty} \left| \frac{x_{k-n}}{2^{\sum_{i=0}^n k+i}}  \right| \leq \frac{1}{2^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left| x_k \right| = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}} \|(x_0, x_1, \dots)\|
\end{align*}
and equality holds for $(x_0, x_1, \dots) = (1, 0, 0)$ as seen above. Thus, $\|T^n\| = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}}$.
Then
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \| T^n \|^{\frac{1}{n}} 
    = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{1}{2^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
    = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{2^{\frac{n+1}{2}}} 
    = 0
\end{equation*}
so $T$ is quasi-nilpotent.

Assume the Banach algebra $\algebra{A}$ is generated by a quasi-nilpotent element $a$.
Then every element can be represented as $a^k$, so the algebra is commutative because $a^m a^n = a^{m + n} = a^n a^m$.
Then for any $b \in \algebra{A}$, we have
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \|b^n\|^\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \|a^{nk}\|^\frac{1}{n} \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} (\|a^n\|^\frac{1}{n})^k = 0^k = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now, let $\phi \in \Omega(\algebra{A})$ be an element of the spectrum of $\algebra{A}$, that is, a non-zero homomorphism $\phi: \algebra{A} \to \mathds{C}$. Because $\phi$ is non-zero (on a fixed element $b \in \algebra{A}$), we have $\|\phi\| > 0$ and for any $n \in \mathds{N}$ the following holds:
\begin{equation*}
    |\phi(b)| = |\phi(b)^{n}|^{\frac{1}{n}} = |\phi(b^n)|^\frac{1}{n} \leq \underbrace{\|\phi\|^{\frac{1}{n}}}_{\to 1} \underbrace{\|b^n\|^\frac{1}{n}}_{\to 0} \to 0 
\end{equation*}
But this implies $\phi(b) = 0$, a contradiction.
Therefore, the spectrum $\Omega(\algebra{A})$ must be empty.

\subsection{Topological zero divisors}

We consider two cases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item First, let $X$ be non-compact.
    Then we have $\inf_{x \in X} |f(x)| = 0$, because if it were $\epsilon > 0$ we would have $X = \{ x \in X \mid |f(x)| \geq \epsilon \}$ non-compact and thus $f \notin C_0(X)$.
    Therefore, we need only prove $\zeta(f) = 0$.

    Choose any $\epsilon > 0$ define $K \coloneq \{ x \in X \mid |f(x)| \geq \epsilon \}$.
    Because $\inf_{x \in X} |f(x)| = 0$, there exists an $x_0 \in X$ for which $|f(x_0)| < \epsilon$ holds (and thus $x_0 \notin K$).
    Because $K$ is compact, it is closed and thus $X \setminus K$ is open.
    Choose an open, pre-compact neighborhood $U_0$ of $x_0$ in $X \setminus K$ and set $K' = X \setminus U_0$.
    The set $\{x_0\}$ is compact, and $K'$ is closed, so Uryson's Lemma yields the existence of a function $b: X \to \mathds{C}$ (with $\|b\| = 1$) (in $C_0(X)$) with $b(x_0) = 1$ and $b|_{K'} \equiv 0$.
    Then for $x \in K \subseteq K'$, we have $|(fb)(x)| = |f(x)| \cdot |b(x)| = |f(x) \cdot 0 < \epsilon$.
    For $x \in K^\complement$, it follows that $|(fb)(x)| = |f(x) \cdot |b(x)| < \epsilon \cdot 1 = \epsilon$ and thus $\|f b \| < \epsilon$. 
    This shows $\zeta(f) = \inf_{b \in C_0(X), \|b\| = 1} \| f b \| = 0$.

    So if $X$ is not compact, $\zeta(f) = \inf_{x \in X} |f(x)| = 0$ holds and every $f \in C_0(X)$ is a topological zero divisor.
    \item Now, let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $f \in C_0(X)$.
    If $f$ is non-invertible, we have $0 \in f(X)$ and thus $\inf_{x \in X} |f(x)| = 0$. 
    In this case, we can argue as we did in the first point and thusly show $\zeta(f) = 0$ in much the same way.

    Consider now an invertible $f$ with $\inf_{x \in X} |f(x)| = k > 0$.
    We conclude 
    \begin{equation*}
        \left\| \frac{1}{f} \right\| = \sup_{x \in X} \frac{1}{|f(x)|} = \frac{1}{\inf_{x \in X} |f(x)|} = \frac{1}{k}\text{,}
    \end{equation*}
    so for any $b \in C_0(X)$ with $\|b\| = 1$ we have $\|f \cdot b\| \cdot \| \frac{1}{f}\| \geq \|f \cdot b \cdot \frac{1}{f} \| = \|b\| = 1$, so $\|f \cdot b \| \geq k$ and therefore $\zeta(f) \geq k$.

    Choose now any $\epsilon > 0$.
    Then $K \coloneq \{ x \in X \mid |f(x)| \geq k + \epsilon \}$ is compact and $K \neq X$ (or $k$ would not be the infimum of $|f(x)|$).
    Just like in the first bullet point, we can choose $x_0 \in X \setminus K$ and fitting neighborhoods to get the existence of a function $b$ fulfilling $\|b\| = 1$, $\|b f \| < k + \epsilon$ and $b \in C_0(X)$.
    Therefore, $\zeta(f) \leq k$ and thus $\zeta(f) = k > 0$.
    This also shows that the (invertible) element $f$ is not a topological zero divisor.
\end{itemize}
To summarize, we have proven $\zeta(f) = \inf_{x \in X} f(x)$ for any $f \in C_0(X)$, that $f$ is a topological zero divisor in a compact space always and in a non-compact space if and only if it is invertible.
It remains to show that in a commutative $C^*$-algebra $\algebra{A}$, $f \in \algebra{A}$ is a topological zero divisor if and only if $0 \in \sigma(f)$.
As $\algebra{A}$ is commutative, we can employ the Gelfand Representation (1.3.6) and conclude that $\algebra{A}$ can be embedded in the algebra $C_0(\Omega(\algebra{A}))$ by $\Gamma$, and $\sigma(f) = \image{\hat{f}}$ (because $\algebra{A}$ is unital, or $\sigma(f)$ would not be defined). 
Then $0 \in \sigma(f) \iff 0 \in \image{\hat{f}} \iff $ $f$ is non-invertible, and because $\Omega(\algebra{A})$ is compact (as $\algebra{A}$ is unital), this is equivalent to $f$ being a topological zero divisor.
