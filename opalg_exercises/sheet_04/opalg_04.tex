\subsection{}

The first statement follows immediately from the fact that the canonical inclusion $\algebra{B} \hookrightarrow \algebra{A}$ is an injective $^*$-homomorphism, so it is isometric as proven in the lecture.

If now $\algebra{B}$ is a dense proper $^*$-subalgebra of $\algebra{A}$, assuming it could be turned into a $C^*$-algebra, the norm on that $C^*$-algebra would already have to be the norm on $\algebra{A}$.
But then the canonical inclusion is isometric and injective, so it has closed range and $\algebra{B} \subseteq \algebra{A}$ is closed and dense in $\algebra{A}$.
Now, however, we have $\algebra{B} = \algebra{A}$, a contradiction.

\subsection{}

As hinted, the disk algebra $\algebra{A}(\mathds{D})$ is such an algebra.
As we have $\overline{\overline{z}} = z$ for all $z \in \mathds{D}$, the identity map is self-adjoint, but because of $i \in \id(\mathds{D})$, $\id - i \cdot 1$ is not invertible.
Thus, $i \in \sigma(\id) \subsetneq \mathds{R}$.

Analogously, we can also consider the character $\phi: \algebra{A}(\mathds{D}) \to \mathds{C}: f \mapsto f(i)$.
Here, we have $\phi(\id^*) = \phi(\id) = i \neq - i = \overline{\phi(\id)}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\then$ (ii): Take $a \in \algebra{A}$ be any self-adjoint element and $(a)$ the $^*$-subalgebra generated by $a$ in $\algebra{A}$.
    Then $\Omega((a)) \subseteq \Omega(\algebra{A})$ (as any character of $(a)$ can be extended to $\algebra{A}$), so any character in $\Omega((a))$ is also symmetric. As $a$ is self-adjoint, we have $\chi(a) = \overline{\chi(a^*)} = \overline{\chi(a)}$ and therefore $\chi(a) \in \mathds{R}$ for any $\chi \in \Omega((a))$.
    As $(a)$ is a commutative $^*$-Banach-algebra, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \sigma_{(a)}(a) \subseteq \{\chi(a) \mid \chi \in \Omega((a)) \} \cup \{0\} \subseteq \mathds{R}\text{.}
    \end{equation*}
    Furthermore, if $a - \lambda \in (a)$ is invertible, it must also be invertible in $\algebra{A} \supseteq (a)$, so $\rho(a)_{(a)} \subseteq \rho_{\algebra{A}}(a)$ and therefore $\sigma_\algebra{A}(a) \subseteq \sigma_{(a)}(a) \subseteq \mathds{R}$.
    \item $\then$ (iii): Let $\Gamma: \algebra{A} \to C(\Omega(\algebra{A})), a \mapsto (\chi \mapsto \chi(a))$ be the Gelfand-transform of $\algebra{A}$.
    We want to prove $\Gamma(a) = \Gamma(a^*)^*$.
    By the Definition of the involution on $C(\Omega(\algebra{A}))$, this is equivalent to $\chi(a) = \overline{\chi(a^*)}$ for any $\chi$ the spectrum and $a \in \algebra{A}$.

    First, let $a \in \algebra{A}$ self-adjoint.
    Then $\overline{\chi(a^*)} = \overline{\chi(a)} = \chi(a)$ as $\chi(a) \in \sigma(a) \subseteq \mathds{R}$.

    If $a \in \algebra{A}$ is not self-adjoint, we can write $a = b + ic$ for self-adjoint elements $b = \frac{a + a^*}{2}$ and $c = \frac{a - a^*}{2i}$ and it follows that
    \begin{equation*}
        \chi(a) = \chi(b + ic) = \chi(b) + i \chi(c) = \overline{\chi(b^*)} + i \overline{\chi(c^*)} = \overline{\chi(b^*) - i \chi(c^*)} = \overline{b^* - i c^*} = \overline{\chi(a^*)}
    \end{equation*}
    and this shows (iii).
    \item $\then$ (i): If $\Gamma$ is a $^*$-homomorphism, then $\Gamma(a^*) = \Gamma(a)^*$ and by the definition of the involution as discussed above this already shows $\chi(a^*) = \overline{\chi(a)}$ for every character $\chi$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{}

Since the spectrum $\sigma(a)$ of $a$ in the non-unital algebra $\algebra{A}$ is defined as its spectrum in the unitization $\tilde{\algebra{A}}$, the spectra in $C(\sigma(a))$ and $C_0(\sigma(a))$ have the same meaning and are not merely notationally equivalent.

Let therefore $\Phi: C(\sigma(a)) \to \tilde{\algebra{A}}$ be the $^*$-homomorphism in the fundamental theorem of functional calculus.
We will consider its restriction $\Psi = \Phi|_{C_0(\sigma(a))}$ and show that it already fulfills the necessary properties.
As $C_0(\sigma(a))$ is a (closed and non-dense) subspace of $C(\sigma(a))$, $\Psi: C_0(\sigma(a)) \to \tilde{\algebra{A}}$ is still a $^*$-homomorphism, and $\id \in C_0(\sigma(a))$ is still mapped to $a$.
It remains to show that $\Psi$ has the appropriate image and is still unique.

To see the uniqueness, note that we can write $\tilde{\algebra{A}} \simeq \algebra{A} \oplus \mathds{C}$ and $C(\sigma(a)) \simeq C_0(\sigma(a)) \oplus \mathds{C}$ and can therefore decompose $\Phi$ into $\Phi = \Psi \oplus \Phi|_\mathds{C}$.
If there existed a second $^*$-homomorphism $\Psi_2: C_0(\sigma(a)) \to \algebra{A}$, then
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi_2 = \Psi_2 \oplus \Phi_\mathds{C}: C_0(\sigma(a)) \oplus \mathds{C} \to \algebra{A} \oplus \mathds{C}
\end{equation*}
were are second $^*$-homomorphism $C(\sigma(a)) \to \tilde{\algebra{A}}$, a contradiction.

Concerning the appropriate image, it is enough to show $\Psi(C_0(\algebra{A})) = C^*(a)$, as clearly $C^*(a) \subseteq \algebra{A}$.
