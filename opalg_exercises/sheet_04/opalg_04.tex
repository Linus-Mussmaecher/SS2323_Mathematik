\subsection{}

The first statement follows immediately from the fact that the canonical inclusion $\algebra{B} \hookrightarrow \algebra{A}$ is an injective $^*$-homomorphism, so it is isometric as proven in the lecture.

If now $\algebra{B}$ is a dense proper $^*$-subalgebra of $\algebra{A}$, assuming it could be turned into a $C^*$-algebra, the norm on that $C^*$-algebra would already have to be the norm on $\algebra{A}$.
But then the canonical inclusion is isometric and injective, so it has closed range and $\algebra{B} \subseteq \algebra{A}$ is closed and dense in $\algebra{A}$.
Now, however, we have $\algebra{B} = \algebra{A}$, a contradiction.
